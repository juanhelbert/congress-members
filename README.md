## Congress Members

This project was created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the [ProPublica Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/), which can retrieve legislative data from the House of Representatives, the Senate and the Library of Congress.

The application lists the members of the congress and offers you the possibility of filter them, know their social networks and contact them.
